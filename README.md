# Nightmare
A 2D story platformer game created in collaboration with Yuling Zhou (yulingz6@uci.edu) and Jingyu Hua (jingyuh9@uci.edu) in Unity3D using PlasticSCM as the version control tool.

## Game Overview
In order to save a loved one, you stole a precious medicine from the Mayor. It turned out to be for his fatally ill daughter, and now the entire town was talking about the tragedy. Today, you are woken up by a knock at your door. Instantly knowing that they’ve found out, you just have to run for your life or face the consequences of what you’ve done.

## About
This was for the class GDIM 31 (Introduction to Programming for Games) in 2023. In the git repo are the Unity3D engine files.

OR

Download the git repo files. Unzip it. Open it on Unity3D. Wait 5 years. Go to the toolbar and select File, then click 'Build and Run'.

The game files are huge. The game itself is hard. It's like a rage bait game. Good luck.
